      The <b>European</b> languages are members of the same family. Their separate
      existence is a <b>myth</b>. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same
      vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their
      pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new
      common language would be <b>desirable:</b> one could refuse to pay expensive
      translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform
      grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages
      coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular
      than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be
      more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be
      as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English
      person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge
      friend of mine told me what Occidental is.The European languages are
      members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For
