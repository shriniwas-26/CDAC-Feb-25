1) Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)?  

#1  Create View Dailyorders  
    as Select Distinct cnum, snum, onum, odate from Orders;
Ans:	Dailyorders view is not updatable because it includes distinct keyword.

#2  Create View Custotals  
    as Select cname, Sum (amt) Sum_Amt from Orders, Customers   
    where Orders.cnum=Customers.cnum  
    Group by cname; 
Ans:	Custotals view is not updatable because it includes aggregation function like sum(), includes join and group by clause thats why it doesn't allow DML operations and it is not updatable.

#3  Create view Thirdorders  
    as Select * from Dailyorders  where 
    odate=’1990-10-03’;  
Ans:	Thirdorders view is updatable because it doesn't contain any aggregates, GROUP BY, DISTINCT, joins, UNION, or subqueries.

#4  Create view Nullcities   
    as Select snum, sname, city  
    from Salespeople  
    where city is NULL   
    OR sname BETWEEN ‘A’ and ‘MZ’;  
Ans: Yes Nullcities view is updatable because it doesn't contain any aggregates, GROUP BY, DISTINCT, joins, UNION, or subqueries.
